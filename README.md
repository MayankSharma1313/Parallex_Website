<h2>Why this project?</h2>
<p>
Starting with this project was an important milestone for me. It's a testament to my initial curiosity and determination to learn HTML and CSS. While it may seem simple, it holds a wealth of memories and lessons learned during my early days of coding. This project reflects the progress I've made since then and serves as a reminder of how far I've come.</br>
